A falling-blocks-type 2D game with a simple but addictive gameplay

## About
The game is a remake of various old, 'classic', columns-like games.
And it's made in an attempt to learn [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

Game-dev framework used is [ggez](https://ggez.rs/).

## Disclaimer
The game is fully functional and without any known bugs that prevent gameplay, but it's not completely finished yet: there are some [bugfixes, improvements and refactorings](https://github.com/rdrmic/color-columns/issues) to be done.
