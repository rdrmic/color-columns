## About
The game is a remake of various old, 'classic', columns-like games.
And it's made in an attempt to learn Rust programming language.

Game framework used is [ggez](https://ggez.rs/).

## Disclaimer
The game is fully functional and without any known bugs that prevent gameplay.
But it's not completely finished yet: there are various [improvements and refactorings](https://github.com/rdrmic/color-columns/issues) to be done.
